            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which you haue lately
<pb facs="tcp:13339:3"/>giuen of your true deſire to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the footſteps of our Lord, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoing ſo heauy a Croſſe for his ſake, with ſo ready and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a mind, hath moued me to dedicate this little Booke of the <hi>Imitation of Chriſt</hi> vnto You: aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſelfe that it will be no leſſe gratefull to You to ſee it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in light, purged from many miſtaken ſentences which were in the former Tranſlation, then the reading and practice therof will be profitable to others; it being ſo diuine and excellent a worke, as in the opinion of ſuch as can beſt iudge of this matter, of all the Bookes which are written, that treate of ſpirit and Chriſtian Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the holy Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, it is inferiour to none, if it excelleth not all.</p>
            <p>No 'booke hath byn more approued by generall conſent, none more often printed and tranſlated
<pb facs="tcp:13339:3"/>into diuers languages, none more eſteemed, commended, yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded alſo by the chiefe Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Spirit of ſome Religious Orders, to be often read by euery one in priuate, and once a weeke publikely to all. So full of ſweet ſenſe is this diuine Flower, that the moſt ſpirituall bees may day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draw from thence great plenty of celeſtiall hony. It is a diſh of ſo diuine meate, that it neuer ſatiates the deuout mind: but as the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth promiſe to all ſuch as fit at that heauenly ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; ſo ſhall they find in this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food, <hi>The more they eate it,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And the reaſon heerof is, for that it contayneth ſo great depth of ſpirit, and ſo great ſtore and variety of heauenly documents, that it ſeemeth euer new to the Reader, and like another Manna affoardeth to euery one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
<pb facs="tcp:13339:4"/>taſt which beſt agreeth with the palate of his ſoule: and none can loath it, but they whoſe luſtes do carry them to Aegyptian ſlauery.

            <p>The practiſe of that which this Booke doth teach, couereth the ſoule with the rich garment of grace, and adorneth it with the ſplendent pearles of Euangelicall Perfection, which maketh vs more pleaſing in the ſight of God, then can the deckings of all earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iewells make the fayreſt Lady in the Kingdome where you are, appeare beautifull to the eyes of men.

            <p>To Yov therfore who haue ſo willingly endured the loſſe of your earthly ſubſtance, I haue thought good to preſent this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall Pearle, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Treaſure contayned in a little roome.

Theſe are the words of Chriſt, by which we are admoniſhed, that we ought to imitate his life, and manners, if we will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:13339:10"/>of his diuine light, and be deliuered from all blindneſſe of hart. Let therfore our chiefeſt care be to meditate vpon the life of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The doctrine of Chriſt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the doctrine of the Saints: and he that had the light of ſpirit, would diſcouer therin a ſecret and hidden Manna. But it falleth out that many, who often heare the Ghoſpell of Chriſt, do yet feele in themſelues but ſlender motion of any holy deſire, becauſe they are void of the ſpirit of Chriſt. But whoſoeuer will fully and feelingly vnderſtand the words of Chriſt, muſt endeauour to conforme his life wholy to the life of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. What will it auaile thee to diſpute profoundly of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if thou be voyd of humility, and therby diſpleaſing to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? High words ſurely, make a man neither holy nor iuſt; but a vertuous life maketh him deare to God. I had rather feele compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, then vnderſtand the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> If thou dideſt know
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13339:10"/>the whole Bible by hart, and the ſayings of all the Philoſophers, what would all that profit thee, without charity, and the grace of God? Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity, but only to loue God,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.</note> and wholy to ſerue him. This is the higheſt wiſdome, by contempt of the world, to tend towards the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is therfore vanity to ſeeke after fading riches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe truſt in them. It is alſo vanity to gape after honours, and to climbe to high degrees. It is vanity to fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>low the appetites of the fleſh, and to labour for that, for which thou muſt afterwards ſuffer more grie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous puniſhment. Vanity it is to wiſh to liue long, and to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to liue well. It is vanity to mind only this preſent life, and not to foreſee thoſe things which are to come. It is vanity to ſet thy loue on that which ſpeedily paſſeth away, and not to haſten thither, where euerlaſting ioy is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Call often to mind this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe:

Who ſo knoweth himſelfe well, groweth daily more contemptible in his owne conceipt, and delighteth not in the praiſes of men. If I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood all that is to be knowne in the world, and were not in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, what would that help me in

                  <p n="2">2. Giue not thy ſelfe to inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire of knowledg: for therin is much diſtraction and deceipt. The learned are willing to ſeeme ſo to others,<note place="margin">1. Cor 8.</note> and to be accoump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted wiſe. There be many things, which to know doth little or no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing profit the ſoule: and he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnwiſe, that beſtoweth his la<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bour about other things, then thoſe that may auaile him for the health of his ſoule. Many words do not ſatisfy the deſires of the hart: but a good life comforteth the mind, and a pure conſcience giueth great aſſurance in the ſight of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How much the more thou knoweſt, and how much the bet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter thou vnderſtandeſt, ſo much the more grieuouſly ſhalt thou ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be iudged, vnleſſe thy life be alſo more holy.

If thou wilt know or learne any thing profitable, deſire not to be knowne, and to be little eſteemed of by men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The higheſt and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable reading is the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; conſideration of our ſelues.

                  <p>HAPPY is he whome Truth by it ſelfe doth teach,<note place="margin">Pſ. 93.1.</note> not by figures, and voices that paſſe away; but as it is in it ſelfe. Our owne opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſenſe do often deceaue vs, and it diſcernes little.<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.</note> What auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it to diſpute and contend about darke and hidden things; wheras for being ignorant of them we ſhall not ſo much as once be reprehended at the day of iudgment? It is a great folly to neglect the things that are profitable and neceſſary, and giue our minds to that which is curious and hurtfull:<note place="margin">Pſ 113.</note> we haue eyes and do not ſee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And what haue we to do with the terms and diſtinctions of Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? He to whome the eternall Word ſpeaketh, is deliuered from multitudes and diuerſities of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By that one Word all things do ſpeake, and all declare the ſame: and this is the beginning, and that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13339:13"/>which ſpeaketh vnto vs. No man without that Word vnderſtandeth or iudgeth rightly. He to whome all things are one, who draweth all things to one, and ſeeth all things in one, may enioy a quiet mind, and remaine peaceable in God. O God, the eternall Truth, make me one with thee in euerlaſting charity. It is tedious to me often to read &amp; heare many things. In thee is all that I would haue, and can deſire. Let all Doctours hold their peace: let all creatures be ſilent in thy ſight: ſpeak thou alone vnto me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. How much the more one is retired within him ſelfe,<note place="margin">Matt. 11. Luc. 10.</note> and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth inwardly ſincere, and pure; ſo much the more, and higher my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries doth he vnderſtand without labour: for that he receaueth light of vnderſtanding from aboue. A pure, ſincere and ſtayed ſpirit is not diſtracted, though he be imploied in many workes: for that he worketh all to the honour of God, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for inward tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillity, without ſeking himſelf in any thing he doth. Who hinders and troubles thee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:13339:13"/>more then the vnmortified deſires of thine owne hart? A good and deuout man firſt of all diſpoſeth in himſelfe his outward works: neither do they draw him to the deſires of an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate inclination; but he ordereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the preſcript of reaſon. Who hath a greater combate, then he that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to ouercom himſelfe? This ought to be our endeauour, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our ſelues daily, to wax ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and be more able to ſubdue our paſſions, and alwaies in this way to get ſome ground.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All perfection in this life hath ſome imperfections mixt with it: &amp; no knowledg of ours is void of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ignorance. An humble knowledg of thy ſelf is a more ſecure way to God, then a deepe ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter learning: yet learning is not to be blamed, nor the only knowledg of any thing whatſoeuer is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked, it being good in it ſelfe, and ordained by God: but a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and a vertuous life is to be preferred before it. And for that many endeauour, rather to get knowledg, then to liue well: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13339:14"/>they are often deceiued, and reape either none, or very ſlender profit of their labours.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. O, if men beſtowed as much labour in the rooting out of vices, and planting of vertues, as they doe in moouing doubts and queſtions; neither would there ſo much hurt be done, nor ſo great ſcandall be giuen in the world, nor ſo much looſnes be practiſed in places erected for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue!<note place="margin">Matt. 23.</note> Truly at the day of ludgment we ſhall not be examined what wee haue read, but what we haue done: nor how well we haue ſpoken, but how vertuouſly we haue liued.

Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the ſimple and pure minds: for they ſhall enioy much peace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is the reaſon, why ſome of the Saints were ſo perfect, and contemplatiue? Becauſe they laboured to mortify the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to earthly deſires; and therefore they could with their whole hart, giue themſelues to God, and freely attend to their owne affaires. We are too much lead by our owne paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and too ſolicitous for tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things. We alſo ſeldome ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come any one vice perfectly, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13339:20"/>are not inflamed with a feruent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to profit in ſpirit: and therfore we remaine cold in deuotion, and full of tepidity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we were perfectly dead vnto our ſelues, and not intangled within our owne breaſts: then we might alſo haue ſome taſt of diuine things, and feele the ſweetneſſe of heauenly contemplation. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and indeed the whole impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, for that we are not free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our paſſions, and diſordered incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: neither do we endeauour to enter into that path of perfection, which the Saints haue walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs: and when any ſmall aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity befalleth vs, we are too quickly deiected, and turne our ſelues to human comforts.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If we endeauour like men of courage to ſtand continually in the battaile; ſurely we ſhould feele the fauourable aſſiſtance of God fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. For he who giueth vs occa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſion to fight, to the end we may get the victory, is ready to ſuccour thoſe that fight manfully, and do truſt in his grace. If we eſteeme our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13339:21"/>in Religious life, to conſiſt only in theſe exteriour obſeruations; our deuotion will quickly be at an end. Let vs ſet the axe to the roote, that being freed from paſſions, we may enjoy true peace of mind.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If euery yeare we would root out one vice, we ſhould quickly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come perfect men. But now often times we perceaue it goeth contrary, and that we were better, and of a more pure conſcience at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of our conuerſion, then after many yeares of our profeſſion. Our feruour and profit ſhould increaſe daily; but now it is acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted a great matter, if one can retaine but ſome part of his firſt ſpirit. If we would vſe but a little violence in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, then ſhould we be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all things afterwards with eaſe and ioy of hart.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. It is a hard matter to leaue that to which we are accuſtomed; but harder to do againſt our owne wils. But if thou doſt not ouercome little and eaſy things; how wilt thou ouercome harder matters? Reſiſt thy inclination in the firſt motions,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:13339:21"/>and breake off euill cuſtomes, leaſt perhaps by little and little they draw thee to greater difficulty. O, if thou dideſt conſider how much inward peace vnto thy ſelfe, and ioy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thou ſhouldeſt procure by demeaning thy ſelfe well; I ſuppoſe thou wouldeſt be more carefull of thy ſpiritual profit.</p>

                  <p>IT is good that we haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times griefe and aduerſities: for they often make a man enter into himſelfe, and remember that he is heere in baniſhment, and ought not to place his truſt in any worldly thing.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13339:22"/>in Iob: Temptation is the life of man vpon earth. Euery one therfore ought to be carefull, and diligently to arme himſelfe with praier againſt his temptations, leaſt the Diuell find time and place to deceaue him; who neuer ſleepeth, but goeth about ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whome he may deuoure. No man is ſo perfect and holy, but hath ſomtimes temptations: and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altogeather free from them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Temptations are often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto men; though they be troubleſome, and grieuous; for in them man is humbled, purged, and inſtructed. All the Saints haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and profited through many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations and temptations; &amp; they that could not beare temptations, became reprobate &amp; fell from God. There is no order ſo holy, nor place ſo ſecret, where there be not temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or aduerſities.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is no man that is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather free from temptations, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he liueth on earth: for in our ſelues is the cauſe therof, being born with inclination to euill. When one temptation or tribulation goeth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13339:23"/>away, another commeth: and we ſhall euer haue ſomething to ſuffer, becauſe we haue loſt that innocency with which we were created. Many ſeeke to fly temptations, and do fall more grieuouſly into the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By flight alone we cannot ouercome; but by patience and true humility, we become ſtronger then all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that only auoideth them outwardly, and doth not plucke them vp by the root, ſhall profit lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: yea temptation will the ſooner returne vnto him; and he ſhall feele himſelfe in worſe caſe then before. By little and little, and by patience with longanimity (through Gods help) thou ſhalt more eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then with violence, and thine owne importunity. Often take cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in temptations, and deale not roughly with him that is tempted; but giue him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, as thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt wiſh to be done to thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The beginning of all euill temptations, is inconſtancy of mind, and little confidence in God: for as a ſhip without a ſterne is toſſed to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13339:23"/>and fro with the waues: ſo the man that is negligent, and leaueth his purpoſe, is many waies tempted. Fyre trieth iron, and temptation a iuſt man. We know not oftentimes what we are able to do, but temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations do ſhew vs what we are. We muſt be watchfull, eſpecially in the beginning of the temptation, for the enemy is then more eaſily ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if he be not ſuffered to enter the dore of our harts, but be reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted without the gate at his firſt knocke. Wherfore one ſaid: With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the beginnings,<note place="margin">Ouid. l. 1. de remed amoris.</note> for an after-remedy comes often to late. Firſt there commeth to the mind an euill thought, then a ſtrong imagination therof, afterwards delight, and an euill motion, and then conſent: and ſo by little and little our wicked enemy getteth full entrance, whilſt he is not reſiſted in the beginning. And how much the longer one is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent in reſiſting: ſo much weaker doth he become daily, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſtronger againſt him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Some ſuffer greateſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the beginning of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13339:24"/>others in the later end; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againe are much troubled al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt through the whole time of their life.

                  <p n="7">7. We ought not therfore to deſpaire when we are tempted; but ſo much the more feruently to pray vnto God, that he will vouchſafe to help vs in all tribulation; who ſurely according to the ſaying of S.

                  <p>THE life of a Religious perſon ought to ſhine with all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> that he may inwardly be ſuch as outwardly he ſeemeth to men. And with reaſon thou oughteſt to be much more within, then is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued without:<note place="margin">Pſ. 33. Heb. 4. Pſ. 15.</note> for God behoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the hart, whom we ought moſt highly to reuerence wherſoeuer we are, and walke in purity like Angels in his ſight; and to renew dayly our purpoſes, and ſtyr vp our ſelues to feruour, as though this were the firſt day of our conuerſion; and to ſay: Help me, my God, in this my good purpoſe, and in thy holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; and graunt that I may now this day begin perfectly: for that which I haue done hitherto, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. According to our purpoſe, ſhalbe the ſucceſſe of our profit, and much diligence is neceſſary to him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13339:30"/>that will profit much. And if he that firmely purpoſeth, often faileth; what ſhall he do, that ſeldome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth any thing, or with little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty? It may fall out ſundry waies that we leaue off our purpoſe: and if for light occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s we omit our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed exerciſes, it ſeldome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth without ſome loſſe. The purpoſe of iuſt men is rather grounded v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the grace of God, then on their owne wiſdome, in whom alſo they alwaies haue confidence, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they take in hand. For man doth purpoſe,<note place="margin">Prou. 16.</note> but God diſpoſeth: neither is the way of man in his owne hands.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If an accuſtomed exerciſe be ſometimes omitted for ſome worke of charity, or of intention to profit our neighbour, it may eaſily after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward be recouered:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.</note> but if it be lightly left through inconſtancy or negligence, it is an offence, and will proue hurtfull. Though we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour what we can, yet ſhall we faile in many things. But yet we muſt alwaies purpoſe ſomthing certaine, eſpecially againſt that which moſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13339:31"/>hinders vs We muſt examine well, and order both our exteriour and interiour actions; for that both are expedient for our progreſſe in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If thou canſt not alwaies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect thy ſelfe, yet do it ſomtimes, and that at leaſt once euery day; to to wit in the morning, or euening. In the morning make thy good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;<note place="margin">Deut. 4.</note> in the euening examine thy ſelfe what thou haſt byn that day in word, deed, or thought: for that in theſe oftentimes perhaps thou haſt offended God, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Arme thy ſelfe with courage againſt the malicious attempts of thine enemy. Refraine Gluttony &amp; thou ſhalt more eaſily bridle all the diſordered inclinations of the fleſh. Neuer be altogeather idle, but either reading, or writing, or praying, or meditating, or labouring ſomthing of profit for the common good: but bodily exerciſes are to be diſcreetly vſed, and not to be vndertaken e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually of all.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thoſe things that be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, are not to be done in the ſight
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13339:31"/>of all: for priuate things are beſt done in ſecret. But thou muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, thou neglect not that to which thou art bound by common rule, and be ready in performing thy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate deuotions: but hauing fully &amp; faithfully accompliſhed all thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and thoſe things that were enioyned thee, if thou haſt further leaſure, returne to thy ſelfe as thy deuotion deſireth. All cannot vſe the ſame exerciſe, but one is more conuenient for this perſon, another for that. According to the diuerſity of times alſo, diuers exerciſes are fitting: for ſome ſuite better with feſtiuall dayes, others with daies of labour. We haue need of one kind in temptations, and of others in time of peace and quiet. We deſire to thinke of other things when we are ſorrowfull, then we do when we are cheerfull in our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When principall feaſts draw neere, good exerciſes are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; &amp; the interceſſions of Saints more feruently to be implored. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feaſt to feaſt, we ſhould make ſome good purpoſe, as though we were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13339:32"/>then to depart out of this world, &amp; to come to the euerlaſting feaſts of heauen. And therfore we ought to prepare our ſelues carefully at holy times, and to liue more deuoutly, and to keep more exactly all things that we are to obſerue, as though ſhortly we were to receaue reward of our labour at Gods hands.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And if it be differred, let vs think that we were not well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> nor worthy as yet of ſo great glory, as ſhall be reuealed in vs at the time appointed: and let vs labour to prepare our ſelues better for our departure.

It is better to purge our ſins, and vices now, then to reſerue them for purgatory. Verily the inordinate loue we beare to our ſelues decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs.</p>

Thou muſt labour heer a while:<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 51.</note> thou ſhalt afterwards haue great reſt; yea euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ioy.<note place="margin">Apoc 21. &amp; 22.</note> If thou continueſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent in ſeruing of God,<note place="margin">Matt. 25.</note> do not doubt but God will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and liberall in giuing thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.

                  <p n="2">2. When one that was in great anxiety of mind, often wauering betweene feare and hope, did once, being oppreſſed with griefe, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate himſelfe in a Church in prayer before an Altar, and ſayd within himſelfe: O, if I knew that I ſhould yet perſeuer! He preſently heard as it were a voice from God, which ſaid: What if thou diddeſt know it, what wouldſt thou do? Do now what thou wouldeſt do then, &amp; thou ſhalt
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:13339:45"/>be ſecure. And being herewith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, &amp; ſtrengthened in mind, he committed himſelfe wholy to the will of God, and that noyſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety ceaſed, neither had he any mind to ſearch curiouſly any further, to know what ſhould befall him; but rather laboured to vnderſtand what was the perfect, and acceptable will of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> for the beginning &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing of euery good worke.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hope in our Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.</note> and do good, ſaith the Prophet, and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the land, and thou ſhalt be fed in the riches therof. One thing there is that draweth many back from that ſpirituall good, and the diligent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of their liues: the horror of the difficulty, and the labour of the combat. But they aboue others profit moſt in vertue, that endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour moſt to ouercome thoſe things, which are grieuous, and contrary vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. For there a man profiteth more, and deſerueth greater grace, where he more ouercometh &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth himſelfe in ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But all men haue not alike to ouercome and mortify: yet he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13339:46"/>that is zealous and diligent, though he haue more paſſions, ſhall profit more in vertue, then another that is of a more temperate diſpoſition, if he be leſſe feruent in the purſuite of vertue. Two things chiefely help to our amendment, to wit, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our ſelues violently from that to which nature is viciouſly inclined; and to labour earneſtly for that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which we moſt want. Be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful alſo to auoid with great diligence, thoſe things in thy ſelfe, which do moſt diſpleaſe thee in others.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Gather ſome profit to thy ſoule out of euery occaſion, and wherſoeuer thou be: ſo as if thou ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt or heareſt any good, ſtir vp thy ſelfe to the imitation therof. But if thou ſeeſt any thing worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, beware thou do not the ſame. And if at any time thou haſt done it, labour quickely to amend it. As thine eye obſerueth others, ſo art thou alſo noted againe by others. O, how ſweet and comfortable a thing it is, to ſee the ſeruants of Chriſt feruent and deuout, endued with vertuous and decent manners!
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:13339:46"/>And on the contrary, how pittifull and grieuous a thing it is, to ſee them that liue in a diſſolute and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſort, not applying themſelues to that, for which they were called! O, how great domage and great danger it is, to neglect the good purpoſes of their vocation, and to buſy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in that which appertaineth not vnto them,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> nor is committed to their care!</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Be mindfull of the purpoſe thou haſt made, and haue alwaies before the eyes of thy ſoule, the picture of thy Sauiour crucifyed. Thou haſt good cauſe to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, looking vpon the life of Chriſt, ſeing thou haſt ſo ſlackly endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to conforme thy ſelfe vnto him, though thou haſt walked a long time in the way of the ſeruice of God. A religious perſon that exerciſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeriouſly, and deuoutly in the moſt holy life, and paſſion of our Lord, ſhall there aboundantly find whatſoeuer is neceſſary, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for him; neither ſhall he need to ſeeke any thing elſwhere,<note place="margin">Gal. 2. &amp; 6.</note> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Ieſus. O, if Ieſus crucifyed
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13339:47"/>would come into our harts, how quickly and fully ſhould we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in all truth!</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A feruent religious perſon taketh, and beareth all well that is commanded him: but he that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent and cold, hath tribulation vpon tribulation, and on all ſides is afflicted: for he is void of inward conſolation, &amp; is forbidden to ſeck externall comforts. A religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that liueth not according to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, is in great danger of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of his ſoule. He that ſeeketh li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and eaſe, ſhall euer liue in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet: for one thing or other will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies diſpleaſe him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. How do ſo many other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, who liue vnder the ſtrict rule of Monaſticall diſcipline? They ſeldome go abroad, they liue retiredly, they feed meanly, they are cloathed courſely, they labour much, ſpeak little, watch long, riſe early, ſpend much time in prayer, read often, and keep themſelues in all kind of diſcipline. Conſider the Carthuſians, Ciſtercians, and the Religious men and women of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:13339:47"/>Orders, how they riſe euery night to ſing praiſes vnto God. And how vnſeemly then it is for thee to be ſlouthfull in ſo holy a worke, when as ſo great multitudes of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons do begin to glorify God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. O, that we had nothing els to do, but alwaies with our mouth, and whole hart to praiſe our Lord God! O, that thou mighteſt neuer haue need to eate, nor drinke, nor ſleepe, but mighteſt alwaies praiſe God, and only imploy thy ſelfe in the exerciſes of ſpirit: thou ſhouldſt then be much more happy, then now thou art, when for ſo many neceſſities, thou art co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrained to ſerue thy body. Would God theſe neceſſities were not at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpirituall refections of the ſoule, which (alas) we taſt of too ſeldome.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. When a man commeth to that eſtate, that he ſeeketh no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of any creature, then doth he begin to take perfect contentment &amp; delight in God. Then ſhall he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with whatſoeuer doth befall
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:13339:48"/>him in this world. Then ſhall he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce in great matters,<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> nor be ſorrowfull for ſmall, but with great integrity and confidence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to God; who ſhall be vnto him all in all: to whom nothing doth periſh, nor dy, but all things do liue vnto him, and ſerue him at a beck without delay.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Remember alwaies the end,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.</note> and how that time loſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer returnes. Without care and diligence thou ſhalt neuer get ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. If thou beginneſt to wax could,<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.</note> it will be euill with thee: but if thou giue thy ſelfe to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſpirit; thou ſhalt find much peace, and feele leſſe labour, through the aſſiſtance of Gods grace, and loue of vertue. The feruent and diligent man is ready, and prepared for all things.<note place="margin">Eccls. 19.</note> It is harder to reſiſt vices and paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then to toile in bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. He that auoideth not ſmall faults, by little and little falleth into greater. Thou wilt alwaies reioyce in the euening, if thou ſpend the day profitably. Be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:13339:48"/>watchfull ouer thy ſelfe, ſtir vp thy ſelfe, warne thy ſelfe, and whatſoeuer becomes of others, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect not thy ſelfe. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter violence thou vſeſt againſt thy ſelfe, the more thou ſhalt profit.</p>

                  <p>VVITH two wings man is lifted vp from earthly vanities, that is, with ſimplicity, &amp; purity. Simplicity ought to be in our intention. Purity in our affection. Simplicity fixeth the eyes of the ſoule in God. Purity apprehendeth and taſteth his ſweetnes. No good action will hinder thee, if thou be inwardly free from inordinate affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If thou intend and ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing els but the will of God, and the profit of thy neighbour, thou ſhalt enioy internall liberty. If thy hart were ſincere and vpright, then euery creature would be vnto thee a looking-glaſſe of life, and a booke of holy doctrine. There is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo little and abiect, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth not the goodnes of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If in thine owne hart thou wert good and pure,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. Prou. 3.</note> then thou wouldeſt be able to ſee and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13339:54"/>all things without any impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A pure hart penetrateth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and pierceth the depth of hell.<note place="margin">Pſ. 118.</note> Such as euery one is inwardly: ſo he iudgeth outwardly. If there be ioy in the world, ſurely a man of a pure hart poſſeſſeth it. And if there be any where tribulation and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, an euill conſcience feels it. As iron put into the fire leeſeth his ruſt, and becometh bright like fire: ſo he that wholy turning himſelfe vnto God, beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth feruent, &amp; is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a new man.</p>

We quickly feele, and weigh what we ſuffer at the hands of others: but we mind not what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſuffer from vs. He that doth well and deeply conſider his owne works, will find little cauſe to iudge hardly of another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſpirituall man preferreth the care of himſelfe,<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> before all other cares. And he that diligently atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

He o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame therfore the loue of man by the loue of the Creator; and he rather choſe the diuine pleaſure, then humane comfort. See thou alſo learne to forſake ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary thing, and a beloued friend for the loue of God. Be not grieued when thou art forſaken by a friend,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13339:61"/>knowing that we all at length muſt be ſeparated one from another.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A man muſt fight long, and with a conſtant mind, before he get the victory, and be able to place his whole hart in God. When a man confideth in himſelfe, he eaſily ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto humane comforts. But a true louer of Chriſt, and a diligent follower of vertue, giueth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to ſuch ſolace, nor ſeeketh ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſweetnes: but rather forcible exerciſes, and to ſuſtaine hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When therfore ſpirituall comfort is giuen thee from God, receaue it thankefully: but know that it is the gift of God, not any deſert of thine. Be not puffed vp, ioy not too much, neither do thou preſume vainely: but be rather the more humble for that grace, and more wary and fearefull in all thy actions: for that houre wil paſſe away and temptation will ſucceed. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſolation is taken from thee, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire not preſently; but with humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and patience attend the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſitation: for God is able againe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13339:61"/>to giue thee greater conſolation. This is not new nor ſtrange vnto them, that haue experience in the way of God: for in the great Saints and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets, there was oftentimes ſuch kind of alteration.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. For which cauſe one when he had grace, ſaid:<note place="margin">Pſal. 29.</note> I ſayd in my plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will not be moued euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But when this was gone from him, he addeth what he found in himſelfe, ſaying: Thou turnedſt thy face fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, and I became trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Yet doth he not deſpaire in the middeſt of theſe changes, but more earneſtly prayeth vnto our Lord, and ſaith:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Vnto thee (o Lord) I will cry, and I will pray vnto my God. Laſtly he receaueth the fruit of his prayer, and witneſſeth that he was heard, ſaying: Our Lord hath heard me,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and taken pitty on me: our Lord is become my helper. But wherin? Thou haſt turned (ſaith he) my ſorrow into ioy,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and thou haſt compaſſed me about with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If great Saints haue byn ſo dealt withall, we that are poore and weake ought not to deſpaire, if we

                  <p n="6">6. Whereupon therfore can I hope, or wherin ought I to truſt, but in the great mercy of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and in the only hope of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly grace? For whether I enioy the preſence of good men, or deuout brethren, or faithfull friends, or holy bookes, or learned treatiſes, or ſweet ſongs and hymnes: all theſe help little, and haue little ſauour, when grace forſaketh me, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine left in my owne pouerty.

                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. I neuer found any ſo religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deuout, that hath not had ſomtimes a withdrawing of grace, or felt not a decreaſe of feruour. There was neuer Saint ſo highly rapt, and illuminated, who firſt or laſt was not tempted. For he is not

                  <p n="8">8. But diuine comfort is giuen, that a man may be ſtronger to beare aduerſities. There followeth alſo temptation, leaſt we ſhould wax proud of that good.

                  <p>IESVS hath now many louers of his heauenly kingdome, but few bearers of his Croſſe. He hath many deſirous of comfort, but few of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. He findeth many compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of his table, but few of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence. All deſire to reioyce with him, few will ſuffer any thing for him, or with him. Many follow Ieſus vnto the breaking of bread: but few to the drinking of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of his paſſion. Many reuerence his miracles,<note place="margin">Luc. 9.22.</note> few follow the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:13339:65"/>of his Croſſe. Many loue Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, as long as aduerſities happen not. Many praiſe and bleſſe him, as long as they receaue any comfort from him. But if Ieſus hide himſelf, and leaue them but a while, they fall either into complaint, or into too much deiection of mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But they that loue Ieſus for Ieſus, and not for ſome comfort of their owne, bleſſe him in all tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and anguiſh of hart, as well as in the greateſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. And although he ſhould neuer giue them comfort, they notwithſtanding would euer prayſe him, and alwaies giue him thankes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. O how powerfull is the pure loue of Ieſus,<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> which is mixed with no ſelfe-loue nor proper intereſt! Are they not all to be called hirelings that euer ſeeke comforts? Do they not ſhew themſelues to be rather louers of themſelues, then of Chriſt, that alwaies thinke of their commoditie &amp; gaine? Where may one be found that will ſerue God, without looking for reward?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is hard to find any one ſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:13339:65"/>ſpirituall, that is free from the loue of all earthly things. For where is any that is indeed poore in ſpirit, and free from all affection of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?

                  <p n="2">2. Why therfore feareſt thou to take vp the Croſſe, which leadeth thee to a kingdome? In the Croſſe is health, in the Croſſe is life, in the Croſſe is protection againſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, in the Croſſe is infuſion of heauenly ſweetnes, in the Croſſe is ſtrength of mind, in the Croſſe is ioy of ſpirit, in the Croſſe is the height of vertue, in the Croſſe is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſanctity. There is nor health of the ſoule, nor hope of euerlaſting life but in the Croſſe.

                  <p n="3">3. Behould in the Croſſe al doth conſiſt, and all lyeth in ending our life vpon it: for there is no other
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13339:67"/>way vnto life, and vnto true inward peace, but the way of the Holy Croſſe, and of daily mortification. Go where thou wilt, ſeeke whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thou wilt: thou ſhalt not find a higher way aboue, nor a ſafer way below, then the way of the holy Croſſe. Diſpoſe &amp; order all thinges according to thy will, and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet thou ſhall euer find, that of neceſſity thou muſt ſuffer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, either willingly or againſt thy will, ſo as thou ſhalt neuer fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide the Croſſe. For either thou ſhalt feele payne in thy body, or in thy ſoule thou ſhalt ſuffer tribulation of ſpirit.</p>

Somtimes thou ſhalt be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, ſomtimes thou ſhalt be troubled by thy neighbours, &amp; which is more, oftentimes thou ſhalt be irkſome to thy ſelfe: neither canſt thou be deliuered or eaſed by any remedy or comfort: but ſo long as pleaſeth God, thou oughteſt to beare it. For God will haue thee learne to ſuffer tribulation without comfort; and that thou ſubmit thy ſelfe wholy to him, and become
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13339:67"/>more humble by tribulation. No man hath ſo liuely a feeling of the paſſion of Chriſt, as he who hath chaunced to ſuffer the like. The Croſſe therfore is alwayes ready, &amp; euery where attendeth thee. Thou canſt not eſcape it, whither ſoeuer thou flyeſt: for wherſoeuer thou go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, thou carrieſt thy ſelfe with thee, and ſhalt euer finde thy ſelfe both aboue and below, without &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: which way ſoeuer thou doeſt turne thee, alwayes thou ſhalt find the Croſſe: and euery where of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity thou muſt haue patience, if thou wilt haue inward peace, and deſerue an euerlaſting Crowne.</p>

Thou art deceaued, thou art deceaued, if thou ſeekeſt any other thing, then to ſuffer tribulations: for this whole mortall life is full of miſeries,<note place="margin">Iob. 7.</note> and inuironed on euery ſide with Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

This is not a worke of humane vertue; but it is the grace of Chriſt, that can, and doth ſo much in fraile fleſh: that what naturally it alwayes abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth and flyeth, that, by feruour of ſpirit, it taketh hould on and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>

                  <p>SONNE<note n="†" place="margin">Our Lord.</note> it is more profitable, &amp; ſafe for thee to hide the grace of deuotion, not to extoll thy ſelfe, nor to ſpeake much, nor to eſteeme much therof; but rather to deſpiſe thy ſelfe, and feare it, as giuen to one vnworthy therof. This affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not to be cleaued vnto, which may be quickly changed into the contrary. Thinke when thou art in grace, how miſerable and needy thou art wont to be without it? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth therin only conſiſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſpirituall life, when thou haſt the grace of comfort; but when thou humbly, reſignedly, and patiently ſuffereſt the withdrawing therof: ſo that thou be not then leſſe diligent in the exerciſe of prayer, nor ſuffer thy ſelfe to paſſe ouer the reſt of thy accuſtomed good works: but that thou willingly performe what lieth in thee, according as thou art able &amp;
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13339:82"/>vnderſtandeſt to be fit: not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting thyſelf wholy for the drineſſe, and trouble of mind, which thou feeleſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are many that when it ſucceedeth not well with them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they become impatient or ſlouthful.<note place="margin">Hierem. 10. &amp; Rom. 9.</note> The way of man is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in his power, but it belongeth to God, to giue, and to comfort when he will, how much he will, &amp; whome he will, as it ſhall pleaſe him and no more. Some vnaduiſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons haue ouerthrowne themſelues for the greedy deſire which they had of the grace of deuotion: attempting more then they were able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, not waighing the meaſure of their weaknes, but following rather the deſire of their hart, then the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reaſon. And becauſe they preſumed on greater matters then was pleaſing to God, they quickly loſt their grace.<note place="margin">Eſa. 14.</note> They were made needy, and left in a deiected eſtate that built themſelues neſtes in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: to the end that being humbled, and impoueriſhed, they may learne not to fly with their owne wings, but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13339:82"/>to liue in hope vnder my fethers. They that are yet new, and vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted in the way of our Lord, vnles they gouerne themſelues by the counſaile of diſcreet perſons, may eaſily be deceaued and ouer throwne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And if they will rather follow their owne iudgment, then giue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to others that are experienced, their end will be dangerous, if they cannot be drawne from their owne conceipt. Seldome thoſe that are wiſe in their owne opinion, ſuffer themſelues humbly to be gouerned by others.<note place="margin">Pſal. 15. &amp; 16.</note> A little knowledg with humility, and a ſlender vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is better then great treaſures of learning with a vaine ſelfe-liking. It is better for thee to haue leſſe, then much of that wherof thou maiſt be proud. He doth not diſcreetly, that wholy giueth himſelf ouer to mirth, forgetting his former pouerty, and the chaſt feare of God, which fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to looſe the grace which he hath obteyned. Neither is he vertuouſly wiſe, that in time of aduerſity or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tribulation whatſoeuer, yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13339:83"/>to deſpairing thoughts, and thinketh and imagineth of me leſſe confidently then he ought.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He that will be ouer ſecure in time of peace,<note place="margin">1. Theſſ. 5.</note> ſhall be often found in time of warre too deiected and fearfull. If thou couldeſt alwaies continue humble, and lowly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy ſelfe, and temper, &amp; gouerne thy ſoule well, thou ſhouldeſt not ſo ſoone fall into danger and offence. It is good counſell, that when thou conceaueſt feruour of ſpirit, thou ſhouldeſt thinke what will become of thee, when that light ſhal leaue thee.<note place="margin">Iob. 17.</note> And when that doth happen, remember the light may returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which for thy inſtruction and my glory I haue withdrawne for a time.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Such proofe is often more profitable, then if thou ſhouldeſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies enioy proſperity according to thy deſire. For merits are not to be waighed in a man by the number of viſions and comforts which he hath, or by his knowledg in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by his being placed in high degree: but in that he is grounded in

That which is pleaſing to others, ſhall go well forwards, that which thou wiſheſt, ſhall not ſpeed. That which others ſay, ſhal

So the bleſſed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Peter required,<note place="margin">1.

                  <p n="2">2. O how great a confidence ſhall he haue at the houre of death, whome no affection to any earthly thing detaineth in the world. But the weake mind is not yet capable of ſo retired a hart; neither doth the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſon vnderſtand the freedome of a recollected mind. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding if he will be truly ſpirituall, he ought to renounce as wel that which is farre off, as that which is neereſt vnto him, and to beware of no man more then of himſelfe.

                  <head>CHAP. LIV. Of the different motions of Nature and Grace.</head>
                  <p>SONNE,<note n="†" place="margin">Our Lord.</note> marke diligently the motions of thine owne nature, and my grace, for in very contrary and ſecret manner theſe are moued, and can hardly be diſcerned but by him that is ſpirituall and inwardly enlightned. All men deſire that which is good, and pretend ſome good in all their words and deeds, &amp; therfore vnder pretence of good, many are deceaued. Nature is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull and ſeduceth, intangleth, &amp; deceaueth many, and alwaies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth her ſelfe for her end, but grace walketh with great ſincerity, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoideth all ſhew of euill, pretendeth not deceipts, &amp; doth all things pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for God, in whome alſo ſhe final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſteth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nature will not willingly dye, nor be kept in, nor ouercome, nor be ſubiect to any, nor be ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but grace laboureth to mortifie
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13339:145"/>her ſelfe, reſiſteth ſenſuality, ſeeketh to be ſubiect, is willing to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and will not vſe her owne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſhe loueth to be kept vnder diſcipline, and deſireth not to rule any, but alwaies to liue and remaine wholy ſubiect vnto God, and for God is ready humbly to bow vnto all men. Nature ſtriueth for her owne commodity, and conſidereth what profit ſhe may reape by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but grace conſidereth not what is profitable and commodious vnto herſelfe, but rather what is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many. Nature willingly recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth honour &amp; reuerence: but grace faithfully attributeth all honour and glory vnto God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nature feareth ſhame and contempt, but grace reioyceth to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer reproach for the name of Ieſus. Nature loueth idlenes, and bodily reſt, but grace cannot be idle, but willingly imbraceth labour. Nature ſeeketh to haue thoſe things that be curious and precious, abhorreth that which is meane and baſe: but grace delighteth in plaine &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble things, deſpiſeth not courſe and meane, nor
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13339:146"/>refuſeth to wear that which is old &amp; torne Nature reſpecteth the things of this world, reioyceth at earthly gaine, ſorroweth for loſſe, is moued with euery little iniurious word; but grace thinketh on that, which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, and cleaueth not to that which fadeth with time; ſhe is not troubled with loſſe, nor exaſperated with iniuries, for that ſhe hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her treaſure and ioy in heauen where nothing periſheth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nature is couetous, and doth more willingly receaue then giue, ſhe loueth proper and priuate things; but grace is pittifull &amp; libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to all, auoydeth ſingularity, is content with a little, thinketh it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier to giue, then to receaue. Nature inclineth to creatures, yieldeth to her owne fleſh, followeth vanities, and liſtneth to diſcourſes: but grace draweth vnto God, and ſeeketh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertues, renounceth creatures, fleſh the world, hateth the deſires of the fleſh, reſtraineth wandrings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, bluſheth to be ſeene in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Nature is willing to haue ſome outward comfort, wherin ſhe may
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13339:146"/>delight her ſenſes, but grace ſeeketh comfort in God alone, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth aboue all viſible things in the higheſt good.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nature worketh all for her owne gaine and profit, ſhe can doe nothing freely, but for beſtowed be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefits: ſhe hopeth to obtaine either that which is equall, or better, either praiſe or fauour, &amp; coueteth to haue her workes &amp; gifts much eſteemed: but grace ſeeketh no temporal thing, nor aſketh any other reward for her deſerts then God alone, not deſireth more of temporall neceſſaries, then what may ſerue her for the obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of euerlaſting glory.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Nature rejoyceth to haue many friends, and kinsfolkes, ſhe glorieth of Noble birth and deſcent, pleaſeth the powerfull, fawneth v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the rich, applaudeth thoſe that are like herſelfe: but grace loueth her enemies, &amp; is not puffed vp with multitude of friends, nor eſteemeth place or birth, but where it is ioyned with greater vertue, ſhe rather fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the poore, then the rich, hath more compaſſion of the innocent,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:13339:147"/>then the powerfull, reioyceth in the ſimple, &amp; reſpecteth not the deceipt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, exhorteth euer the good to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the better gifts, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to reſemble the ſonne of God. Nature quickly complaineth of any want and trouble: grace conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffereth all kind of need.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nature turneth all things to her ſelfe, ſtriueth and contendeth for her ſelfe: but grace reduceth all to God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence originally they proceed: ſhe aſcribeth no good to her ſelfe, neither doth ſhe arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſume of her ſelfe: ſhe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, nor preferreth her opinion before others, but in euery ſenſe &amp; vnderſtanding ſubmitteth her ſelfe vnto the eternall wiſdome, and to the diuine iudgment. Nature coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to know ſecrets, and to heare newes; ſhe will appeare a broad, and make proofe of many things by the experience of her owne ſenſes, ſhe deſireth to be known, &amp; to do thoſe things, for which ſhe may be praiſed and admired: but grace careth not for hearing news, nor to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d curious matters, for that all this
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13339:147"/>ſpringeth from the ancient diſorder of our corrupt nature, ſeing nothing that is new, is durable vpon earth. She teacheth therfore to reſtraine the ſenſes, to auoid vaine pleaſing, and oſtentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, humbly to hide thoſe things that are worthy of praiſe and admiration, and of euery thing and euery knowledg to ſeeke profitable fruite, and the praiſe and honour of God: ſhe will not haue her ſelfe nor hers publickly praiſed, but deſireth that God ſhould be bleſſed in his gifts, who of meere charity beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This grace is a ſupernaturall light, and a certaine ſpeciall gift of God, and the proper marke of the elect, and pledge of euerlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, which lifteth vp a man from earthly baſenes to loue things of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; of a carnall maketh him a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall perſon. How much the more therfore nature is depreſſed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, ſo much the greater grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, and the inward man daily by new viſitations more perfected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Image of God.</p>

                     </gap>ons therof, vnleſſe thy holy grace feruently infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hart do aſſiſt me.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thy grace o Lord, &amp; great grace is needfull, that nature may be ouercome, which is euer prone to euill from her youth. For by Adam the firſt man, it falling &amp; being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſinne, the penalty of this ſtaine hath deſcended vpon all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in ſuch ſort, that nature it ſelfe,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13339:148"/>which by thee was created good, &amp; without defect, is now accompted for vice, and for the infirmitie of a corrupted nature, for that the motio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof left vnto it ſelfe, draweth to euill and abiect things. For the little force which remaineth, is like a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſparke, lying hidden in aſhes. This is naturall reaſon it ſelfe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with great darkneſſe, ſtill retayning power to diſcerne good and euill, and the diſtance be tweene true and falſe, although it be vnable to fulfill all, that it approueth and enioyeth not now the full light of truth, nor the former integrity of her affections.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hence it is, my God, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my inward man I delight in thy law,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> knowing thy comman dements to be good, iuſt, and holy, reprouing alſo all euill and ſunne, and do know that it is to be fled.. But in my fleſh I ſerue the law of ſir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:13339:149"/>I want grace to help my infirmity, for a light reſiſtance I go back, and faint. I know the way of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and ſee cleerly inough what I ought to do, but preſſed with the weight of mine owne corruption, I riſe not vnto it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. O Lord, how needfull is thy grace for me,<note place="margin">Ioan. 13.</note> to begin any good worke, to go forward, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. For without it I can do nothing, but in thee I can do all things, when thy grace doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me. O heauenly grace, without which our owne merits are nothing, and no gifts of nature are to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Arts, riches, beauty, &amp; ſtrength, wit, or eloquence are of no worth with thee, o Lord, without thy grace. For gifts of nature are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to good &amp; euil, but the peculiar gift of the elect is grace and loue, wher with being marked, they are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med worthy of euerlaſting life. This grace ſo much excelleth, that neither the gift of propheſie, nor the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of miracles, nor any ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how high ſoeuer, is of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme without it.

                        </gap>.</note> My iudgments are to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, not to be diſcuſſed, for they are
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13339:153"/>ſuch as cannot be comprehended by the vnderſtanding of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In like manner I aduiſe thee not to inquire, nor diſpute of the merits of the Saints, which of them is holier then the other, and which is greater in the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Theſe things oftentimes breed ſtrife and vnprofitable contentions,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.</note> they nouriſh alſo pride &amp; vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from whence do vſually ſpring enuy and diſſentions, whilſt one wil needs fooliſhly haue this Saint pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and the other, another. To deſire to know and ſearch out ſuch things, is to no purpoſe, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe the Saints, of whome they ſpeake. For I am not the God of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion, but of peace, which peace conſiſteth rather in true humility, then in exalting our ſelues.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some are carried with zeale of affection, to loue theſe, or thoſe moſt, but this loue is rather humane then diuine. I haue made all the Saints, and haue giuen them grace: I haue made them partakers of my glory. I know the merits of euery one, I haue preuented them in the
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:13339:154"/>benedictions of my ſweetneſſe. I foreknew my beloued before the beginning of the world.<note place="margin">Ioan. 15.</note> I choſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the world, they choſe not me firſt. I called them by grace, I drew them by mercy, I led them through ſundry temptations. I haue ſent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> great inward comforts, I haue giuen them perſeuerance, I haue crowned their patience.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I know the firſt and laſt: I imbrace all with ineſtimable loue. I am to be praiſed in all my Saints, I am to be bleſſed aboue all things, &amp; to be honoured in euery one, whom I haue thus gloriouſly exalted, and predeſtinated without any precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t merits of their owne. He therfore that contemneth one of the leaſt of my Saints,<note place="margin">Iac. 2.</note> honoureth not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, for that I made both the leſſe and the greater.<note place="margin">Sap. 6.</note> And he that diſprai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth any of my Saints, diſpraiſeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo me, and all the reſt in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen. All are one by the band of Charity, they thinke the ſame, they will the ſame, and are all knit togeather in one perfect band of loue.</p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:13339:154"/>
                  <p n="5">5. But yet (which is much more high) they loue me more then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and more then their owne merits. For being rauiſhed aboue themſelues, and drawne out of the affection of themſelues, they tend wholy vnto the loue of me, in which alſo they reſt, enioying me with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable glory. Nothing can put them backe, nothing preſſe them downe; for being full of euerlaſting truth, they burne with the fire of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable charitie. Let therefore carnall and earthlymen, that can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no other but priuate ioyes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to diſpute of the ſtate of Saints. They adde and take away according to their owne fancies, not as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the euerlaſting Truth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is in many great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ſpecially in thoſe that be ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly enlightned, and theſe can ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome loue any with perfect ſpiritual loue. They are alwaies much drawne by a naturall affection, and humane friendſhip to this man or to that, &amp; according to the experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they haue of themſelues in their earthly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo they frame an imagination
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:13339:155"/>of heauenly things. But there is an incomparable diſtance betweene the things, which the imperfect frame in their conceipts, and thoſe which illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated perſons do ſee by reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from aboue.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Beware therfore, my Sonne, that thou treat not curiouſly of theſe things,<note place="margin">Eccli. 3.</note> which exceed thy knowledg, but rather ſo apply thy endeauours, that thou maiſt at leaſt haue the meaneſt place in the Kingdome of heauen. And if any one did know which of the Saints exceeded others in ſanctity, or is eſteemed greater in the Kingdome of heauen, what would this knowledg auaile him, vnleſſe he ſhould thereby humble himſelfe the more in my ſight, and ſtirre vp his mind to praiſe my name with greater feruour. His labour is much more acceptable vnto God, that thinketh of the greatnes of his ſinnes, and his want of vertues, &amp; how far off he is from the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Saints; then he that diſputeth of their greatnes. It is better to pray to the Saints with deuotion &amp; tears, and to craue their glorious ſuffrages
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:13339:155"/>with an humble mind, then to ſearch their ſecrets with vaine curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. They are well and right wel contented, if men could content the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and refraine from theſe vaine diſcourſes. They glory not of their owne merits, for they aſcribe no good vnto themſelues, but attribute all to me, who of my infinite chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty haue beſtowed my bleſſings vpon them. They are repleniſhed with ſo great loue of my Godhead, and ſo ſuperaboundant ioy, that there is no glory nor happines, that is, or can be wanting vnto them. All the Saints how much the higher they be in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo much the more humble they are in themſelues, and neerer and deerer vnto me. And therfore thou haft it writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.</note> That they did caſt their Crownes before God, and fell down vpon their faces before the Lambe, and adored him that liueth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>

I rather chooſe to be a Pilgrime in earth with thee, then to poſſeſſe heauen without thee Where thou art, there is heauen: and there is death and hell, where thou art not. Thou art my deſire, and therfore it behoueth me to ſend forth deep ſighes from my hart, and crie and pray vnto thee. For I haue none to truſt vnto, none that can help me in tyme of neceſſity, but thee alone, my God. Thou art my hope, and my truſt; thou art my

But there is no heed to be taken of his frauds and malicious ſuggeſtions, be they neuer ſo filthy and hideous, but all is to be turned back vpon his owne head.

                  <p>OMOST ſweet Lord Ieſu, how great is the delight of a deuout ſoule that feaſteth with thee in thy banquet, where there is no other meate offered to be eaten, but thy ſelfe her only beloued, and moſt to be deſired aboue all the deſires of her hart. And verily it would be a great comfort vnto me, to powre out teares from the bottome of my hart in thy preſence,<note place="margin">Luc. 7.</note> and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout Magdalen to waſh thy feet with the teares of mine eyes. But where is this deuotion? Where is ſo plentifull ſhedding of holy teares? Surely in the ſight of thee and thy holy Angels, my whole hart ſhould
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:13339:179"/>be inflamed and diſſolue into teares for ioy. For I enioy thee in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament really preſent, although hidden vnder another forme.</p>

For to behould thee in thine owne diuine brightneſſe, mine eyes would not be able to endure it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the whole world ſtand in the clearneſſe of the glory of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty. Thou therfore prouideſt for my weakneſſe in that thou couereſt thy ſelfe vnder the Sacrament. I do really enioy and adore him, whome the Angels adore in heauen, but I as yet for the time in faith, they in his proper forme, and without ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. I ought to be contented with the light of true faith, and to walke therin, vntill the day of euerlaſting brightneſſe breake forth, and the ſhaddowes of figures paſſe away. But when that ſhall come which is perfect,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> the vſe of Sacraments ſhall ceaſe.

                  <p>THOV oughteſt to ſeeke the grace of deuotion inſtantly, to aſke it earneſtly, to expect it patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and confidently, to receiue it ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to keep it humbly, to worke

Thou oughteſt chiefly to humble thy ſelfe, when thou feeleſt inwardly little or no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and yet not to be too much deiected, nor to grieue inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it.

                  <p n="2">2. If grace ſhould be alwaies preſently giuen, and at hand euer with a wiſh, it could not be well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured by a weake man.

It is ſometimes a ſmall matter that hindreth and hideth grace from vs, if it be to be called ſmall, and not rather a great matter, that hindreth ſo great a good.

For nothing will taſt ſo well, and pleaſe thee ſo much, as the will and pleaſure of God.

                  <p>O MOST ſweet &amp; louing Lord whome I now deſire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue deuoutly, thou knoweſt my infirmity, and the neceſſity which I endure, with how many ſinnes I am oppreſſed, how often I am grieued,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:13339:188"/>tempted, troubled, and defiled. I come vnto thee for remedy, I craue of thee thy heauenly comfort, and the eaſe of my paine. I ſpeake to him that knoweth all thinges, to whome all my ſecrets are open, and who can only perfectly comfort and help me. Thou knoweſt what it is, wherof aboue all things I ſtand in moſt need, and how poore I am in vertues.</p>

Refreſh this thy hungry and needy creature, giue heate vnto my coldneſſe with the fire of thy loue, giue light vnto my blindneſſe with the brightneſſe of thy preſence. Turne all earthly things vnto me, into bitterneſſe, all things grieuous and contrary, into patience, all baſe and created things, into contempt and obliuion. Lift vp my hart to thee in heauen, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me not to wander vpon earth: be thou only ſweet and delightſome vnto me from henceforth for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, for thou only art my meate, and my drinke, my loue and my

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:13339:189"/>Saints and deuout perſons haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thee, when they receaued thy Sacrament, who were moſt pleaſing vnto thee in holineſſe of life, and moſt ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in deuotion.

                  <p>The voice of the Beloued.</p>
                  <p>THOV oughteſt to beware of curious and vnprofitable ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching into this moſt profound Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou wilt not ſink into the depth of doubt.<note place="margin">Prou. 25.</note> He that is a ſearcher of Maieſty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, ſhalbe oppreſſed by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. God is able to worke more then man can vnderſtand. A pious and humble inquiry of truth is tolerable, ſo he be alwaies ready to be taught, and do endeauour to walke in the ſound pathes of the ancient Fathers
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:13339:191"/>doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſſed is that ſimplicity, that forſaketh the difficult waies of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and goeth on in the plaine and aſſured path of Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Many haue loſt deuotion, whilſt they would ſearch after high things. Faith and ſincere life are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at thy hands, not height of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, nor the depth of the myſteries of God. If thou doeſt not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor conceaue thoſe things that are vnder thee, how ſhalt thou be able to comprehend thoſe that are aboue thee? Submit thy ſelfe to God, and let thy ſenſe be ſubiect to faith, and the light of knowledge ſhall be giuen thee in that degree, as ſhall be profitable and neceſſary for thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some are grieuouſly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted about faith and the Sacrament, but this is not to be imputed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather to the enemie. Do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nor diſpute with thy thoughts, neither do thou giue anſwere to the doubts moued by the enemie, but belieue the words of God, belieue his Saintes and Prophets, and the wicked Serpent will fly from thee.
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13339:191"/>It is oftentimes very profitable to the ſeruant of God to ſuffer ſuch things. For he tempteth not Infidels and ſinners, whome he already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely poſſeſſeth, but he ſundry waies tempteth &amp; vexeth the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deuour.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Go forward therfore with a ſincere and vndoubted faith, and come to the Sacrament with vnfaig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned reuerence. And whatſoeuer thou art not able to vnderſtand, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

God deceaueth thee not: he is deceaued that truſteth too much to himſelfe.<note place="margin">Pſ. 19. &amp;c. 118.</note> God walketh with the ſimple,<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe to the humble, giueth vnderſtanding to little ones, openeth the ſenſes of pure minds, and hideth grace from the curious and proud.

                  <p n="5">5. All reaſon &amp; naturall ſearch ought to follow faith, not to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, nor impugne it. For faith and loue do chiefly excell, &amp; worke in a hidden manner in this moſt bleſſed and excellent Sacrament.
